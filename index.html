<p>My name is Mason Adams. I am a part time student while I work full time. Im learning how to code and other IT focused content to try and move careers. Currently I am a Hydraulic specialst and work on many different types of hydraulic componets. These componets can range from pumps, motors, valves, drives, swivles, etc. I have loved computers for years but never thought about it as a full time job, only a hobby.</p>
